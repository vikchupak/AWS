6. IAM, ACCOUNTS AND AWS ORGANISATIONS
   - IAM users, policies, groups, roles
   - [Service-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create-service-linked-role.html) & PassRole policy
     - Service-linked roles
        - Roles predefined by the service and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf
        - A role is linked directly to an AWS service
     - PassRole policy
       - A role is linked (assigned) to a service
       - The service has to assume the role to get required permissions
       - You has a policy with PassRole action which says you authorized to pass the role to the service when calling it
       - Better mental model
         - IAM Role = a badge with permissions
         - Trust policy = who is allowed to wear that badge
         - AssumeRole = putting the badge on
         - PassRole = pointing at a badge and saying “that service may wear this one”
