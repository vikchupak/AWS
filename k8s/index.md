- Elastic Container Registry (ECR) - private docker repository for container images. Alternative to dockerhub, nexus
- AWS Fargate - serverless compute engine for containers that lets you run applications without managing EC2 instances.
  - It works with both Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
  - **Key Features of AWS Fargate**
    - **No Server Management** – No need to provision, scale, or maintain EC2 instances.
    - **Automatic Scaling** – Fargate automatically scales based on the task or pod requirements.
    - **Pay-as-You-Go** – You pay only for the CPU and memory your containers use, **NOT whole EC2 instance.**
    - **Security Isolation** – Each task or pod runs in its own isolated environment.
    - **Seamless Integration** – Works with ECS (Amazon’s container orchestration) and EKS (Kubernetes).

- **Elastic Container Service (ECS)** - container orchestration service. **AWS version/replacement of k8s**
  - Create ECS cluster containing all the services to manage the containers
  - Control plane is free
  - Represents a Control Plane managing the containers, created automatically with the cluster
    - **EC2-hosted worker nodes**
      - Containers run on EC2 instances
      - We have to create EC2 instances yourself, **join them to the cluster**, check if you have enough EC2 instances and resources to run containers. We have to manage EC2 instances' OS, like updates. Install docker runtime and `ECS Agent`
          - Then, EC2 instances are part of ECS cluster and the `Control Plane - ECS Agents` mange containers on the instanses
          - Each EC2 instance has docker runtime installed to run containers and `ECS Agent` to communicate with the Control Plane to manage containers
      - So, we do not manage containers, but still have to manage servers(EC2 instances)
        - **Container orchestration is managed by ECS**
        - **Hosting infrastacture are still managed by you**
          - Create EC2s
          - Install Docker runtime and ECS Agent
          - Manage OS
          - Join EC2s to ECS cluster
          - Check if enough resources
      - Advantage: Full access and controll of your infrastracture
    - **Fargate-hosted worker nodes**
      - Runs containers in **serverless** way(we do not create servers yourself, but servers are created and **fully managed by AWS**)
        - **So we do not see fargate instances resources in our account**
      - Servers are added based on the need to run containers
      - Pay only for what your system actually consuming
      - **1 node per pod**
        - This is why fargate NOT suitable for
            - Stateful apps
            - Deamon sets
- **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** - managed k8s service. **Original k8s in AWS**
  - Create EKS cluster containing all the services to manage the containers
  - EKS deploys and manages k8s Control Plane Nodes with all required services/processes
  - Control plane is **NOT** free
  - Control Plane Nodes automatically replicated across multiple availability zones (AZ)
    - **EC2-hosted worker nodes (Compute Fleet)**
      - Create EC2 instanses and connect them to the cluster
      - We have to create EC2 instances yourself, **join them to the cluster**
        - Install docker runtime to run containers and `k8s processes` to communicate with the Control Plane to manage containers
        - Check if you have enough EC2 instances and resources to run containers.
        - We have to manage EC2 instances' OS, like updates
        - **Install docker runtime and k8s processes yorself**
      - When, EC2 instances are part of ECS cluster the `Control Plane - k8s processes` manage containers on the instanses
    - **EC2-Nodegroup-hosted worker nodes**
      - Creates and deletes EC2 instances for you, but you need to configure this. It is like bulk create.
      - **Installs everything worker nodes need automatically, like k8s processes (containerd, kubelet, k-proxy)**
      - But managing OS is still your responsibility
      - No nodes autoscaling out-of-the-box. You need to configure it on both side k8s and AWS
    - **Fargate-hosted worker nodes**
      - The same as for ECS Fargate-hosted worker nodes

Ways of running containers:
- EC2 - manyally provisioned virtual servers
- Fargate - on-demand automatically provisioned virtual servers

---

- We can use `ECS` with:
  - EC2 (self-managed by you)
  - Fargate(fully-managed by AWS)
- We can use `EKS` with:
  - EC2 (self-managed by you)
  - EC2-based Nodegroup (semi-managed by AWS)
  - Fargate (fully-managed by AWS)
