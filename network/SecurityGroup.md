# SG

- Ref to itself. So all resouses in the same SG can talk to each other.

- SG bcloks public and private IPs traffic.
  - Traffic is blocked by **source IP**, which can be either public or private IP
  - Private and public IPs newer overlap

---

- Source IP - network communication originator's IP
- Destination IP - Actual adress we want to reach - final point.
- Target IP - Closest/next hop to reach the destination - intermediate point
