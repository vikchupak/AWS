# Authoritative DNS servers(Authoritative Name Servers) vs nameservers

`Authoritative Name Servers` and `Authoritative DNS servers` mean the same thing.

### 🧠 **Both Terms Refer to the Same Concept**

* **“Authoritative Name Server”** is the more precise DNS term.
* **“Authoritative DNS Server”** is a broader or simplified way of saying the same thing.

`Authoritative Name Servers` vs `nameservers`

They’re **closely related but not exactly the same thing**.

### 🧩 **1. “Nameservers” (general term)**

**Nameservers** are DNS servers that **store and respond to queries about domain names** — they tell the internet where to find your website, email, etc.

When you buy a domain (e.g., from GoDaddy), you’ll often see:

```
ns49.domaincontrol.com
ns50.domaincontrol.com
```

These are the **nameservers** assigned to your domain.
They tell the world which DNS system is responsible for your domain’s DNS records.

---

### 🧭 **2. “Authoritative Name Servers”**

An **Authoritative Name Server** is a **specific kind of nameserver** — it’s the one that **actually holds the real DNS records** for your domain (like A, MX, TXT, etc.) and gives the **final, official answer**.

For example:

* `ns49.domaincontrol.com` and `ns50.domaincontrol.com` might be the **authoritative name servers** for your domain if your DNS is hosted by GoDaddy.
* If you use Cloudflare, then `abby.ns.cloudflare.com` and `john.ns.cloudflare.com` become the authoritative servers instead.

### 🔄 **So in short:**

| Term                          | Description                                                     | Example                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Nameservers**               | General DNS servers linked to your domain.                      | ns1.godaddy.com                               |
| **Authoritative Nameservers** | The nameservers that actually store and serve your DNS records. | ns1.godaddy.com (if GoDaddy manages your DNS) |

✅ **Every authoritative nameserver is a nameserver**,
❌ but **not every nameserver is authoritative** for your domain.

# Aws managed dns vs Global dns

### 🧩 **Managed DNS**

**Definition:**
A **managed DNS** is a DNS service where a provider (like AWS Route 53, Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Google Cloud DNS, etc.) hosts and manages your domain’s DNS records.

**Purpose:**
It replaces you having to run your own DNS servers. The provider handles:

* High availability and redundancy
* Fast propagation
* Automatic scaling
* Security (DNSSEC, rate limiting, etc.)

**Example (AWS):**
If you host your domain in **Amazon Route 53**, that’s a **managed DNS** — AWS manages the infrastructure that answers DNS queries for your domain.

**Analogy:**

> Think of managed DNS as a “DNS-as-a-Service” where you just define records (`A`, `CNAME`, etc.), and AWS takes care of uptime and performance.

---

### 🌍 **Global DNS**

**Definition:**
**Global DNS** refers to the **worldwide, hierarchical network** of DNS servers that make up the *Domain Name System* — the entire internet’s DNS infrastructure.

This includes:

* **Root DNS servers** (`.`)
* **Top-level domain (TLD)** servers (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.)
* **Authoritative name servers** (like your managed DNS provider)
* **Recursive resolvers** (Google DNS 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, your ISP’s resolver)

**Analogy:**

> Global DNS is the *entire phone book of the Internet*. Managed DNS is just your page in that phone book — managed by someone reliable.

---

### 🧠 Example in Context

Let’s say:

* You register `example.com` at a registrar.
* You set its **nameservers** to Route 53:
  `ns-123.awsdns-45.org`, `ns-456.awsdns-78.com`

Now:

* **Route 53** is your **managed DNS** (hosted zone).
* The **global DNS system** knows (via TLD `.com` servers) that queries for `example.com` should go to **Route 53’s nameservers**.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

| Term            | Description                                                  | Scope               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Managed DNS** | DNS service hosted by a provider like Route 53 or Cloudflare or GoDaddy | Your domain or app  |
| **Global DNS**  | The worldwide DNS hierarchy (root → TLD → authoritative)     | The entire Internet |

Here’s a **conceptual diagram** of how a DNS query flows — from a user’s browser all the way down to your managed DNS (like AWS Route 53, or GoDaddy, or Cloudflare):

## 🌍 **DNS Query Flow: Global → Managed DNS**

```
User Browser
     │
     ▼
1️⃣ Local DNS Resolver (e.g. ISP or system cache)
     │
     │ (If not cached)
     ▼
2️⃣ Root DNS Servers
     │
     │ "Who manages .com domains?"
     ▼
3️⃣ TLD DNS Servers (.com)
     │
     │ "Who is authoritative for example.com?"
     ▼
4️⃣ Authoritative Name Servers (Managed DNS)
     │   e.g. Route 53: ns-123.awsdns-45.net
     │        GoDaddy:  ns01.domaincontrol.com
     ▼
5️⃣ Response → A/AAAA/CNAME record (e.g. 18.222.44.100)
     │

User Browser connects to IP → Website loads
