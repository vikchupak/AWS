# AWS resource vs AWS managed service

In AWS, the terms **"resource"** and **"managed service"** refer to different types of components, each with a distinct level of AWS involvement in its management. Here's a breakdown:

### **1. AWS Resource**
A **resource** is a resource within AWS that you **create** and **manage**, but AWS handles the underlying infrastructure for it. You still need to configure, monitor, and interact with the resource directly, but AWS ensures its availability, performance, and security at the infrastructure level.

#### **Examples of Resources**:
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: You create and attach an IGW to a VPC, but AWS handles the networking and routing infrastructure.
- **Elastic IP (EIP)**: You allocate and associate Elastic IPs with resources, but AWS manages the underlying networking and ensures its availability.
- **Security Groups**: You define the rules for your security group, but AWS ensures the security of the underlying infrastructure.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **User-configured**: You create and configure the resource.
- **AWS-managed infrastructure**: AWS takes care of the infrastructure that supports the resource (e.g., networking, availability).
- **Not fully managed**: You are responsible for the configuration and updates of the resource.

### **2. AWS Managed Service**
A **managed service** is a fully managed offering by AWS, where AWS takes responsibility for much of the operational overhead, including provisioning, scaling, patching, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of the service. These services are designed to reduce the management burden on the user.

#### **Examples of Managed Services**:
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: AWS handles database provisioning, patching, backups, scaling, and monitoring.
- **AWS Lambda**: You simply upload your code, and AWS handles provisioning, scaling, and running the execution environment.
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: AWS takes care of the scaling, durability, and availability of the storage.
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**: AWS automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand without requiring the user to manage instance scaling.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **AWS fully manages**: AWS handles most of the operational tasks such as scaling, patching, and monitoring.
- **No direct infrastructure management**: You don't need to worry about hardware, scaling, or maintaining the service; you simply use it.
- **Focus on usage and business logic**: The user focuses on interacting with the service and configuring it for their needs rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

### **Key Differences**:
| **Aspect**                | **Resource**                                        | **Managed Service**                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Management Responsibility** | You manage and configure it directly                       | AWS manages most or all of the operational overhead            |
| **User Configuration**     | You create, configure, and manage the resource (e.g., IGW)  | AWS automatically provisions, scales, and maintains the service (e.g., Lambda) |
| **Scaling & Availability** | AWS manages the infrastructure, but you handle scaling      | AWS takes care of scaling, fault tolerance, and availability   |
| **Examples**               | Internet Gateway, Elastic IP, Route Table, Security Groups  | RDS, Lambda, S3, EC2 Auto Scaling                             |

### **Summary:**
- **Resources** are AWS components that you need to **create** and **manage**, but AWS handles the underlying infrastructure.
- **Managed Services** are fully managed by AWS, meaning AWS takes care of most operational aspects like provisioning, scaling, patching, and maintenance, allowing you to focus on your application logic.
