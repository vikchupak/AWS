# Firewall

- [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/)
  - Protects your VPC network traffic (Layer 3–4)
  - Sits inside your VPC, typically in a dedicated firewall subnet
- [AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/)
  - Protects web applications (Layer 7)
  - Attaches to
    - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    - CloudFront
    - API Gateway
    - AppSync
  - Web Access Control List (Web ACL) is the main configuration unit in AWS WAF
    - Web ACL is the container for Rules and Rule Groups you define
    - You can configure "inteligent" feedback loop based on logs generated by WAF to update Web ACL automatically
  - Can write logs to S3
  - Web ACL Capacity Units (WCU) - Default 1500
    - "Measurement" of Rules complexity
  - A resource can have ONLY one WEB ACL associated. But the same WEB ACL can be associated with many resources
