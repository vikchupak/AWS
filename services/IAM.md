Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM resources
- Users (Human users, Service users)
- User Groups (Add users to groups to grant permission via policies)
- Policies [like permissions]. We can provide 
- Roles
  - We cannot assign policies[permissions] to ASW services directly as for common users. To grant persissions to a service, we assign a Role with policies to the service.
- Identity providers
