# Best practices

### Sections order

In CloudFormation, a template is a JSON or a YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure.
Templates include several major sections.
The Resources section is the only required section.
Some sections in a template can be in any order.
However, as you build your template, it might be helpful to use the logical ordering of the following list, as values in one section might refer to values from a previous section.
Take note that all of the sections here are optional, except for Resources, which is the only one required.

- Format Version
- Description
- Metadata
- Parameters
- Mappings
- Conditions
- Transform
- Resources (required)
- Outputs
