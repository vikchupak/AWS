- Primary. Writes/reads
- Standby. No reads/write instance. Synchronous sync between Primary and Standby
- Replica. Reads only. Async sync between Primary and Replica

- **RDS - Single AZ**
  - Default
  - One instanse
- **RDS - Multi AZ**. 1 Standby instance in another AZ, but it is not reachable. For HA - stay available with minimal downtime in case of failover due to Automatic Failover
- **RDS - Multi-AZ Cluster**. Uses 1 primary + 2 replicas only
  - Each instance in different AZ. MySQL, PostgreSQL
  - For High Availability (HA) due to **AUTOMATIC Failover**
  - Synchronous replication
  - Aurora like, but Aurora still better in all parameters. Aurora allows up to 15 replicas
- **RDS - Read Replicas(RR)**
  - Adds up to 5 replicas for primary instance
  - For Read Scalability
  - Asynchronous replication
  - MANUAL FALOVER
  - Exists for both - Classic RDS and Aurora
- **RDS - Custom**
  - Designed for workloads that need full OS-level and database-level customization
  - Supported only Oracle, MS SQL Server
- **Aurora (Provisioned)**
  - Default
  - Uses cluster
  - 1 single-primary instance + replica instances
  - Uses shared cluster volume
- **Aurora Global Database**
  - Provisioned
  - Add read replicas between (up to 5) regions
- **Aurora Multi-master**
  - DEPRICATED
  - Provisioned
  - Add 2 primary(write) nodes
- **Aurora serverless v2**
  - Scales automatically
  - No need in managing instances by customer
  - Uses Aurora Capacity Units (ACU)
- **RDS proxy - Proxy for RDS connection pool**
