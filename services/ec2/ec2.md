- EC2 are VMs
- EC2 Hosts - physical servers where EC2 run
  - EC2 Host AZ resilent
  - EC2 instance is NOT AZ resilient
- EC2 Storage
  - Instance (local) store (ephemeral)
    - **Block** storage devices
    - **NOT all EC2 support it**
    - Storage physically **attached to the host** where your EC2 instance runs
    - Data is lost when:
      - instance **stops or terminates**
        - Stopping instnce frees space on host, so the next time we run istance it has to be run on another host
      - host hardware fails
  - (Remote) storage
    - [EBS](https://github.com/vikchupak/AWS/blob/main/services/ebs/ebs.md)
    - S3
    - EFS
  - Data network
    - This is not storage. It is the network for EC2 data transfer
      - Instance → EBS traffic
      - Instance → S3 traffic
      - Instance → Instance traffic
- **Remote Storage are AZ resilent and `non-cross-AZ shareable`**
