# Ways to call Lambda

## ✅ 1) **From another AWS service**

(Recommended within backend)

You can directly call Lambda from:

* Another Lambda
* SQS
* SNS
* EventBridge
* Step Functions
* DynamoDB streams
* S3 events

➡️ No API Gateway needed.

---

## ✅ 2) **From your backend (server → Lambda)**

Example: Your own server (Node, Go, NestJS, etc.) uses AWS SDK:

```js
import { LambdaClient, InvokeCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lambda";

const client = new LambdaClient({ region: "eu-central-1" });

const res = await client.send(new InvokeCommand({
  FunctionName: "myFunction",
  Payload: JSON.stringify({ message: "hi" }),
}));
```

➡️ No API Gateway needed.
But your server must use AWS credentials.

## ❌ 3) **From a browser / mobile app → Lambda**

You **cannot call Lambda directly** from a client app without exposing AWS credentials.

So you have 2 options:

### ✅ Option A — Use **API Gateway**

Client → API Gateway → Lambda
✔️ Most common
✔️ Easy to secure with Cognito
✔️ No AWS keys required in client
➡️ Recommended

### ✅ Option B — Use **Cognito Identity Pool + AWS SDK**

Client gets temporary IAM creds → invoke Lambda via AWS SDK
⚠️ Rarely used directly
⚠️ You must give IAM access to Lambda → less secure
✔️ API Gateway not required

### ✅ Option C — Expose lambda url without auth check

⚠️ Anyone can call your lambda

So **technically** you can avoid API Gateway, but it’s **not recommended**.

# ⭐ Recommended Pattern

```
Client (web/mobile)
       ↓  (JWT)
API Gateway —(invoke)→ Lambda
```

Why this is best:
✅ No AWS keys on client
✅ Easy Auth (Cognito Authorizer)
✅ Middleware / validation
✅ Rate limiting + throttling
✅ Logging
✅ Custom domains

# ✅ Summary Table

| Caller                          | API Gateway required? | Good idea? |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| AWS service → Lambda            | ❌                     | ✅          |
| Backend server → Lambda         | ❌                     | ✅          |
| Client (web/mobile) → Lambda    | ✅ (recommended)       | ✅          |
| Client → Lambda (Identity Pool) | ❌                     | ⚠️ Avoid   |

# 🔥 If using Cognito as auth provider

Best architecture:

```
App → Cognito → API Gateway → Lambda
```

**API Gateway uses Cognito User Pool Authorizer, so Lambda only runs for authenticated users.**
