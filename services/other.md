- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  -  Amazon S3 is more of an **object storage system** rather than a traditional key-value database like Redis or DynamoDB. It is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data, including files, backups, and multimedia.
  - An **S3 bucket** is a container for storing objects (data files), where each object consists of a file and its metadata.
  - Structure:
    - **Buckets**: S3 uses "buckets" as containers for storing data. Each bucket has a unique name within the AWS global namespace.
    - **Objects**: Each object in a bucket is stored with a unique identifier called a key, which is used to access the object.
    - **Object Metadata**: Objects can also have metadata (key-value pairs) associated with them to provide additional information about the object.
  - Structure example `s3://my-bucket/images/photo.jpg`
    - **[container]** Globally unique bucket name: `my-bucket`
    - **[key]** Object identifier (like a file name or path) `images/photo.jpg`
    - **[value]** The actual data stored in the object, such as the file content, which could be an image, document, or any other data.

- Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
  - A scalable, high-performance block **storage** service **designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances**.
  - Attached to EC2 via **EBS volumes**.
  - Data on EBS volumes is persistent, even when the associated EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.
  - When an EC2 instance is created, **by default, an Amazon EBS volume is attached as the root volume** (this is the storage device where the operating system is installed).
    - Typically of the General Purpose SSD (gp3) type.
    - The root volume is automatically mounted to / (the root directory) of the EC2 instance, **meaning it holds the OS** and other essential files.
    - This EBS volume persists even if the EC2 instance is stopped or started again. **However, if the EC2 instance is terminated, the root volume is by default also deleted, unless specified otherwise.**
  - If you create **snapshots of this root volume**, the snapshot can be used to restore or launch new EC2 instances from the same volume configuration.
  - If you create a **new EBS volume from a snapshot of a root volume** and attach it to the same instance, the system **DOES NOT** inherently recognize the new volume as a root volume. The new volume is treated as a secondary device.
    - If your intention is to replace the root volume, detach the original root volume, attach the new volume as /dev/xvda, and ensure it has the correct boot loader and configuration.
- Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) [**Virtual network in the cloud**]
- AWS CloudFormation
  - Allows you to model, provision, and manage AWS resources in a declarative, **infrastructure-as-code** approach. With CloudFormation, you define the infrastructure and configuration you need using a **template written in JSON or YAML**.

- ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)
  - Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a general term used by AWS to refer to their suite of load balancing services.
