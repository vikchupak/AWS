- All s3 objects and buckets are private by default
- Have flat structure. Folders are just emulated with prefixes

- versioning
  - delete marker is used to mark deleted objects. But object are not really deleted
- s3 multipart upload
  - splits upload file on pieaces and sends them in parallel
- s3 transfer acceleration
  - uses edge locations and AWS network to send data faster

---

- S3 Standard (Better for frequently accessed important/non-replaceable data)
  - Replicated across at least 3 AZs in a region
  - "Milliseconds" first byte latency
  - Billed for
    - GB data stored
    - GB transfer OUT
    - 1000 requests
- S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) (Better for infrequent accessed important/non-replaceable data)
  - Replicated across at least 3 AZs in a region
  - "Milliseconds" first byte latency
  - Billed for
    - GB data stored (cheaper than S3 Standard)
    - GB transfer OUT (cheaper than S3 Standard)
    - 1000 requests (cheaper than S3 Standard)
    - GB retrival
    - Min duration charge of 30 days
    - Min size/capacity charge of 128KB per object
- S3 One Zone-IA (Better for infrequent accessed non-important/replaceable data)
  - Like S3 Standard-IA
  - Replicated within 1 AZ
  - "Milliseconds" first byte latency
  - Billed for
    - GB data stored (costs about 20% less than Standard-IA)
    - GB transfer OUT (costs about 20% less than Standard-IA)
    - 1000 requests (costs about 20% less than Standard-IA)
    - GB retrival
    - Min duration charge of 30 days
    - Min size/capacity charge of 128KB per object
- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
  - Like S3 Standard
    - Replicated across at least 3 AZs in a region
    - "Milliseconds" first byte latency
    - Billed for
      - GB data stored
      - GB transfer OUT
      - 1000 requests
  - But
    - Data accessed once per qtr
    - GB data storing is cheaper
    - Longer Min duration charge of 90 days
    - More expensive retrieval
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
  - Like S3 Standard
  - But
    - **No "Milliseconds" first byte latency**
      - Access time
        - Expedited (1-5 min)
        - Standard (3-5 hours)
        - Bulk (5-12 hours)
    - Objects can't be public
    - Longer Min duration charge of 90 days
    - Min size/capacity charge of 40 KB per object
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  - Like S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
  - But
    - Longer Min duration charge of 180 days
    - **No "Milliseconds" first byte latency**
      - Access time
        - Standard (12 hours)
        - Bulk (up to 48 hours)
- Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective storage class (Machine lerning is used for that)
